## 2026-04-18 — Track 1, fix #1: Gmail connector availability on claw

**Claim:** "Gmail connector is disabled on claw and needs a PATH fix."

**Investigation:** SSH'd to claw, inspected live gateway state.

**Finding:** ❌ **CLAIM WAS WRONG.** The issue was stale state from a previous gateway run, not a PATH bug. After a gateway restart at 06:17:45 UTC on 2026-04-18:

```
[connector-registry] enabled: Google Calendar (batch)
[connector-registry] enabled: Gmail (batch)
[connector-registry] enabled: Linear (batch)
[connector-registry] skipped: Slack (not available)
[connector-registry] enabled: WhatsApp (realtime)
[plugins] [orbit] connectors enabled: calendar, gmail, linear, whatsapp
[connector-registry] batch poll scheduled: gmail every 2h
```

Direct reproduction on claw:

```
$ node -e "const {execFileSync} = require('child_process'); console.log(execFileSync('which', ['gws'], {encoding: 'utf8'}))"
/usr/bin/gws
```

**Resolution:** No code change needed. Moving to fix #2.

**Unexpected bonus finding:** plugin already has `identity cache: 11822 contacts, 860 LID mappings` on startup — some LID→phone bridging was already implemented by an earlier session.

## 2026-04-18 — Track 1, fix #2: preserve `source_event_id` / `thread_id` / `body_preview` / `direction` / `source` on INTERACTED edge

**Claim:** "Ingest pipeline drops ~40% of handoff-prescribed audit fields at `/api/v1/ingest`. Fix: add 5 nullable fields to the INTERACTED edge + the ingest payload schema."

**Change:**
- [src/lib/neo4j.ts](../src/lib/neo4j.ts): extended `InteractionBatchItem` interface with `source`, `sourceEventId`, `threadId`, `bodyPreview`, `direction` (all `string | null`). Cypher `CREATE (a)-[:INTERACTED {...}]->(b)` now writes all five fields.
- [src/app/api/v1/ingest/route.ts](../src/app/api/v1/ingest/route.ts): extended the interaction payload type with matching optional fields. `body_preview` truncated to 160 chars defensively. Null fallback for each.

**Safety:**
- Additive only — Neo4j is schemaless; old INTERACTED edges (without these fields) continue to read fine as null.
- Payload fields are optional — existing plugin sends without them, server writes nulls, no regression.
- No migration, no data rewrite, no breaking change.

**Evidence:**
```
$ npx tsc --noEmit
(exit 0, no output)
```

**Still pending (not part of this commit):**
- Plugin update to actually SEND `source_event_id` / `thread_id` / `body_preview` in the ingest payload. Without this, the new fields write nulls.
- Vercel deploy — until the new server code is live, plugin changes can't be tested end-to-end.
- Real-data verification: after both land, query a sample INTERACTED edge and confirm the new fields are populated.

**Rollback:** `git revert <commit-hash>` — safe at any time since the change is additive.
